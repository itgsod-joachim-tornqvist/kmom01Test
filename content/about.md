This is my first attempt at using Anax flat and markdown to create a website.
At the moment i find it quite odd and hard to understand but I guess I will get used to it after a while.

The markdown part it self is quite easy to understand, it was easy to learn how to write text, make lists and post images for example. It is more so the structure of Anax flat that is confusing.
